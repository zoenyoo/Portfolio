Designing flyers and outreach materials was a large part of my 2022 summer internship with oTIS. Generally, I made these by starting with a template design, then making maps, adding text, and adding other design elements such as photos or diagrams. On several occasions, after completion I would hand out these flyers in-person on street walkthroughs or community gatherings.
