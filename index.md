Designing flyers and outreach materials was a large part of my 2022 summer internship with oTIS. Generally, I made these by starting with a template design, then making maps, adding text, and adding other design elements such as photos or diagrams. On several occasions, after completion I would hand out these flyers in-person on street walkthroughs or community gatherings.

In this project, I collaborated with [Jasmine Siyu Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasmine-siyu-wu-6567b7194/) to model train delay on the New Jersey Transit system. This delay is part of a conceptual tool for the NJ Transit Trip Planner app to show riders the predicted amount of train delay during their travels. Our model is mainly based on historic data around time delay, but also takes into account weather factors.
